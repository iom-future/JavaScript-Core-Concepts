//Asynchronous JS is just an umbrella term that handles async codes and mechanism for handling them

//Async codes
/* this are code blocks that runs independtently of other code blocks in the call stack for various reason like:
1) it slows tan others execution because, it takes to much time to executes .
*/
//Causes of Async codes
/* async codes are cause by timers , fetching data -- from data base, web API, Node API etc
so its not the mechanism that makes it responsive but the process
*/

//Mechanism for handling Async codes
/* the mechanism for handling async codes deals with the various ways async function are treated after excution/completion
Mechanism for handling async codes mostly handles : Executing another task after an async function and how it affect the call stack,
through:
1) Call Back: What happens after the async Operation
2)  Promise: The various states after the async Operation(pending,resolved,rejected)
3)  Async/Await: This handles the various promises ; promises handles the state, async/Await handles them
